# AdvancedForestPlanning
This repository holds my work for the Dr. Bettinger's Advanced Forest Planning course. We solved a forest harvesting problem using a variety of methods including exact methods and heuristic methods. The problem we solved involved minimizing woodflow deviations from a target across several time periods subject to several spatial and policy constraints for a given set of forest stands.
